# GrandFather-s-Email-Instructions

Instructions to help my grandfather use his email. 

My grandfather is soon to be 90 years old. As a result, he is having trouble remembering how to use and acesses his email on his 
desktop computer. To help him out, I wrote him a set of 'user-friendly' instructions on how to find the email icon, how to open and
view his email, and finally how to send an email to people he wishes to communicate. 

While this seems like a simple task that could have just been done in word, my grandfather unfortunitly is/was in an odd predicament
where a plain .docx wouldn't solve his problem. His internet kept cutting in and out. He neither had word nor pages, nor LibreOffice
writer. Infact the only text editor he did have was notepad. So how to you make a ledgable document with notpad? 

My soultion was to make an html document. 

I'll admit it isn't much, but it is enough that my grandfather can open up his email and send someone a message.
